/*
 * By Wakeland Branz
The Freemont Automobile Factory has discovered that the longer a worker has been on the job, the more parts the worker can produce. 
Write an application that computes and displays a workerâ€™s anticipated output each month for 24 months assuming the worker starts by producing 4,000 parts and increases 
production by 6 percent each month. Also display the month in which production exceeds 7,000 parts (when the worker deserves a raise!). 
Save the file as IncreasedProduction.java.
