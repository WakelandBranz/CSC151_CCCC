Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local customers. It charges $3.25 for a dozen eggs, or 45 cents for individual eggs that are not part of a dozen. 
Write a program that prompts a user for the number of eggs in the order and then display the amount owed with a full explanation using the following wording: 
You ordered 27 eggs. Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at $3.25 per dozen and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of $7.85.  
You can name the class Eggs.java
